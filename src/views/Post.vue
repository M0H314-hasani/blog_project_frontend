            <h4>
              Becoming a better blogger is just like becoming a better guitarist
            </h4>
            <p>
              There’s no way you become a great (or even decent) guitarist
              without picking up a guitar, grabbing a music book, learning where
              the notes and positions are, and this is the most important part,
              <strong>practicing the guitar.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You don’t play the song the right way the first time. You don’t
              play it perfectly.&nbsp;Instead, you play, and you play, and you
              play – again and again and again – until you get good.
            </p>
            <p>And the same is true for blogging.</p>
            <p>
              You want to get better at writing. You must write. Not a little. A
              lot. Consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the bad stuff you do, the mistakes you make, go away after
              time. But you have to put in the time to make everything work.
            </p>
            <h4>I delivered a 2-hour workshop on this</h4>
            <p>
              This past weekend I delivered a two-hour workshop on becoming a
              better blogger. It was enough time to dig into details, but not so
              long that people got bored.
            </p>
            <p>
              After all, there are tons of questions that I normally get when
              talking with folks about getting better at blogging.
            </p>
            <p>So I crafted the workshop around those questions:</p>
